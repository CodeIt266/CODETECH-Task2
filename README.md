Overview of the Project

Project: Create A VULNERABILITY SCANNING TOOL

Objective:-
The objective of this task is to develop a tool capable of identifying and analyzing security vulnerabilities within a network or website. This includes detecting open ports and 
assessing the associated services for potential risks, verifying the use of up-to-date software versions to maintain security standards, and evaluating HTTP headers for 
configuration weaknesses that may expose systems to threats. The tool will generate a detailed vulnerability report with actionable recommendations to enhance overall security and 
address identified issues.

Key Activities:-
1. Port Scanning: Find out which ports are open on the target system and check what services or protocols are running on them.

2. Service Analysis: Look for any outdated or weak software versions on the identified ports.

3. HTTP Header Inspection: Check if important security headers, like X-Frame-Options, are missing or wrongly set.

4. Data Validation: Make sure the input, like an IP address or URL, is correct before starting the scan.

5. Report Generation: Create a report with all findings and give suggestions to fix the issues.

Technologies Used:-
1. Python: The main programming language used to build the tool, providing powerful libraries for network tasks.

2. Nmap Library: Helps with scanning networks and ports, allowing detailed checks of open ports and services running.

3. Socket Library: Ensures the IP addresses or URLs entered are valid before starting the scan.

4. String Manipulation: Used to process and organize scan results to make them easier to understand.

5. Conditional Logic and Loops: Automates the process of analyzing the scan results and giving useful recommendations based on the findings.

Key Insights:-
The goal is to develop a tool that scans networks or websites for common security vulnerabilities. It identifies open ports, checks for outdated software versions, and inspects HTTP headers for any misconfigurations. The tool then generates a detailed report that highlights these issues, helping users strengthen their security. Automating the scanning process ensures efficiency and consistency while minimizing the need for manual intervention. Additionally, the tool validates user input to ensure accurate scans and prevent errors. Addressing the detected vulnerabilities helps improve system security and reduces the risk of cyber threats.
